1. the first few steps are now done in Python
	- reading/parsing the expression from mathematica
	- converting/writing to form

2. form codes expand the expression
	- index contraction ported to python
	- intermediate simplifications done in form

3.  sums over kh-indices done in python (appending)
	- the ir-reduction etc. is the same and done in form

4.  integration routines still done in python
